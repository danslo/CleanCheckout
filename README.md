# Clean Checkout for Magento 2

A drop-in replacement for the Magento 2 checkout.

## Features

- Overall checkout improvements, such as;
    - Show input labels next to the fields
    - Allow disabling checkout fields like telephone, company, etc.
    - Remove the header and footer from the checkout entirely.
    - Force totals mode, so the customer is aware of totals during entire checkout.
    - In addition to the above, always show cart items for additional clarity.
    - Move cart/totals blocks to more logical places.
    - Remove jerkiness when switching between checkout steps, and allow setting of step transaction speed.
    - Allow disabling of useless shipping method step with just 1 available option.
    - Allow changing of checkout colors using useful colorpickers.
    - Uses [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to provider better icons.
- Geo IP: Customer country is detected and immediately injected in the right places so it will be used for Shipping and Billing country fields and for calculating tax estimates.
- Social Login: Uses [Hybridauth](https://hybridauth.github.io/) to allow customers to login with their favorite social media.
- Newsletter: Lets customers immediately subscribe to the newsletter from the final step in the checkout.
- Address Autocompletion: Using the [Google Maps Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-addressform), we can significantly reduce the number of fields required by the customer.
- Field Order: Allow administrators to choose their own order of checkout fields.

All of these features are highly customizable from the backend.
